This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a small react project built for fun. It hits both the Open Movie database and the youtube api, to get information about the film, and show 3 youtube videos.

### The app makes use of the following
- Class components
- Functional components
- Styled components
- Axios
- It also ensures that the components are controlled
